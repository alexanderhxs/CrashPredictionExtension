This repository is based on the crash prediction pipeline and data from the following repository: https://github.com/Ludivine388/Crash-Prediction. The code for the evaluation and models are taken from the Atlas-Benchmark, a framework for evaluating pedestrian trajectory predictions: https://github.com/boschresearch/the-atlas-benchmark
